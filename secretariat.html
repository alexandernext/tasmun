      <p>
      Dear participants of TASMUN XII, 
      <br>
      <br>We are your Secretaries-Generals, Lauren and Kristin. Having both started our MUN journeys at TAS in the seventh grade, we have been able to witness the program flourish, providing valuable learning experiences for the students of our community. We are honored to be serving as the Secretaries-Generals for this year’s conference and we hope to put back into this program what we have gained from it. 
      <br>From US Congressman John Lewis’s last letter, written shortly before his passing and published on the day of his funeral, he chose to use his last words to send a message to the future generation. John Lewis called upon readers to continue his life’s work of fighting for justice and equality, saying “Now it is your turn to let freedom ring.”  John Lewis has always been a symbol of equality, from when he was the youthful leading figure of the civil rights movement to his career in Congress where he continued to fight for the rights of many. His life’s work was dedicated to combating inequalities and never did he lose this sense of direction. He embodies the essence of justice and inclusion. We drew inspiration from Lewis’s lasting and memorable words to build our conference theme. 
      <br>This year, the theme we chose was “Passing the Torch of Inclusion and Justice.” The torch is symbolic of the responsibility of advancing the cause of equality and the hope of our new generation. This idea of handing off the torch to the ambitious future generation particularly resonates with us, as it channels the purpose of why we hold our TASMUN conferences annually: to foster a new generation of promising problem solvers that want to make a positive difference in our world. 
      <br>We look forward to seeing all of you at our conference and are excited to see the future generation at work.  
      <br>
      <br>Best regards,
      <br>Kristin C. and Lauren H. 
      <br>Secretaries-Generals

      <p>Model United Nations is an activity that prompts all participants to view pressing, relevant matters through a multitude of lenses, weighing the feasibility of solutions and considering all parties affected. Since you are reading this, I ascertain that you also see the value in global citizenship, and I urge you to continue learning more! My name is Laura Hwa, a junior at Taipei American School, and I am honored to be serving as your Deputy Secretary-General for Delegate Mentorship for TASMUN 2021. With this role, I have the fantastic opportunity to hone the research and speaking skills of the next generation, hopefully inspiring some to take the next steps with their advocacy or civil engagement. Come join us at our conference this spring, it will be a blast!

      <p>While all MUN conferences are similar, I can assure you that the TASMUN 2021 conference will be spectacular. As a part of the Secretariat Team, it is our duty to make TASMUN the best conference for you and for us. Hi, I’m Connie Lee, and I am a Junior at Taipei American School. I am happy to serve as your Deputy Secretary-General of Delegate Mentoring along with my partner, Laura Hwa. TASMUN got me started in MUN, and allowed me to learn beyond just resolution writing and global politics to partnership and leadership. I have participated in numerous conferences off-island, including SHASMUN, THIMUN Singapore, THIMUN Hague and so on. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions, and most importantly, I look forward to seeing all of you at this year's conference :)

      <p>With the great opportunities and certain privileges we behold, fulfilling our parts as global citizens is a vital factor to consider in advancing our society and lives - with your dedicated leadership, care, and involvement, we are only one step closer. Welcome, my name is Abigail Cho and it is my utmost honor to operate as the Global Goals Director, with the goal of expanding and sustaining impact in our community this year and beyond, for TASMUN 2021! Now in my third active year of Model United Nations, my continuous expansion of interest and awareness in politics, social sciences, and current events has only pushed my career forward rapidly; as the world transforms, my enthusiasm towards international issues proceeds to grow stronger - in doubtful times, I hope yours does, or will, as well. One of the greatest rewards MUN has given me beyond the ability to comfortably speak in front of large crowds with confidence and sophistication is realizing how much potential we all have - and these key traits are some I value profoundly. With this year's team, along with our passionate characters, we hope to bring to our conference a memorable, meaningful, and satisfying experience.

      <h4 class="item-subtitle">Deputy Secretary-General of Outreach</h4>
      <p> 
        We live in a time where an unprecedented pandemic underscores the importance of diplomacy and cooperation amid global uncertainty. We live in a time where global unity is more critical than ever as we “turn the page… to heal” in 2021. We live in a time where the lives and fundamental rights of all human beings, regardless of their race, wealth, national origin, gender, or sexual orientation, must be protected, in a time where minority groups must be empowered to fight systemic oppression and discrimination. In an effort to work towards a better, more equitable world, I am incredibly excited to work with you as we Pass the Torch of Inclusion and Justice.
<br>My name is Ethan Yang (pronouns he/him), and it is both an honor and privilege to serve as your Deputy Secretary-General of Outreach for TASMUN 2021  Through the eyes of a delegate, committee chair, and Secretary-General, MUN has helped me become a better public speaker and leader engaged in current issues, and at the same time inspired me to discover the impact we can make on the world through diplomacy and negotiation. Outside of organizing Model United Nations conferences both in the virtual and real world, I am an avid aviation enthusiast and love traveling around the world. In addition, I am a passionate Congressional Debater, and I enjoy learning and speaking about the fascinating world of Politics and International Relations. Having grown up in a democratic island nation known for its progressive values, Taiwan's unique heritage has helped shape my international perspective as an open-minded global citizen. With open arms and an open heart, I look forward to welcoming you personally to TASMUN 2021! :)

      <p>Hi everyone, I am Laura Hsu, a current junior at Taipei American School, and I am honored to serve as the Deputy Secretary-General of Press for TASMUN 2021. As the DSG of Press, I work with student journalists in regards to journalism, and spend time training, lecturing, and mentoring TASMUN press team members every week. Other than mentoring student journalists, I also assign stories, edit journalism articles, and design the TASMUN Press newspaper that will be released during the conference. This year, I am placing an emphasis on fostering a welcoming environment for press team members. As the training process progresses, each student journalist has become increasingly familiar with journalistic writing in the context of MUN. Make sure to join the TASMUN 2021 conference and grab a copy of the TASMUN Press newspaper as well :) Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or feedback for the TASMUN newspaper and see you at the conference!
